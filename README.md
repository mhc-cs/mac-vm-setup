# mac-vm-setup
setup script for virtual machines on MacOS with Multipass

### Here's what the setup script does:
  * installs and/or updates the Homebrew package management system
  * installs Multipass and other required components
  * creates a virtual machine using the current long-term support version of Ubuntu Linux
  * reminds you to enable Full Disk Access for multipassd (the Multipass process) so that folder sharing will work
